# Welcome to Belize Help!

BelizeHelp is a service Belizeans use to discover and help other Belizeans in need. With the advent of the pandemic, times are tough and Belizeans are facing a lot of unforeseen difficulties. We're aiming to help you find verified Belizeans in need!

## How it works

1. Create a request for donations and specify the things you need.
2. Belizeans see your donation requests and can decide to help you through your difficult time.
3. Connect with each other to figure out delivery of the donated items.
